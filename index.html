      <h2>The Laborious Life of Jimmy The Stitch</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Jimmy came from a big small-town in California, where he presumably lived under an abandoned car. He was picked up as a stray, 
          and before coming to his forever home he lived by his wits, scrounging for food, water, and protection from the big world around him.
          His hair was matted down to the skin, and he sported a softball-sized cyst on the top of his head. At only 13 pounds, and underweight at that, 
          the cyst was a significant feature. He was not adoptable from the local kill-shelter.
        </p>
        <p>As luck would have it, Jimmy was sent to Oregon Dog Rescue, where he underwent a shave, antibiotics for an infection, and surgery to get rid of his head-lump.
          He came to us in the midst of a snow-and-ice event with a collar and ten huge, uneven stitches holding the top of head together. He was a little crazy.
