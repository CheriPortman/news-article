          <h3 class="bit-name">History</h3>
          <p>Jimmy came from a big small-town in California, where he presumably lived under an abandoned car. He was picked up as a stray, 
            and before coming to his forever home he lived by his wits, scrounging for food, water, and protection from the big world around him.
            His hair was matted down to the skin, and he sported a softball-sized cyst on the top of his head. At only 13 pounds, and underweight at that, 
            the cyst was a significant feature. He was not adoptable from the local kill-shelter.
          </p>
          <p>As luck would have it, Jimmy was sent to Oregon Dog Rescue, where he underwent a shave, antibiotics for an infection, and surgery to get rid of his head-lump.
            He came to us in the midst of a snow-and-ice event with a collar and ten huge, uneven stitches holding the top of head together. He was a little crazy.

          <h3 id="adoption" class="bit-name">Adoption</h3>
          <p>Jimmy, quickly re-christened Stitch, first encountered the Oregon Outdoors when there was 6 inches of snow and ice on the ground. His shaved, California-acclimated, cone-wearing 
            body very much disliked all the cold, and we had to shovel paths for him to go to the bathroom. In the end, he just found the closest short-pile of snow and 
            peed on it. We decided it was a fair compromise, even though his snow-piles were all on our deck.

          <h3 id="acclimation" class="bit-name">Acclimation</h3>
          <p>Stitch is a resiliant soul, and he's settled in well. He and our other dog are not exactly friends two years after adoption, but they are 
            reluctant companions. Their overlapping interests include treats, barking at passers-by, and belly rubs. Stitch has taken over all the toys in the 
            household, and one isn't properly greeted into our home without a cheery fanfare of squeeky toys. The polite response
            to a Stitch Squeeky Greeting is a quick game of tug-of-war.

          <p>Life with Stitch has rules.</p>
          <p>You must pet him. You must keep petting him, or he will grab your hand with his paw and drag it toward him.</p>
          <p>Do not blow on him. He will smack you with his paw. In the face. He is not gentle.</p>
          <p>Squeaky toys must be dropped off the edge of the bed, where they can be vigilantly watched by leaning precariously over the edge.</p>
          <p>It is perfectly appropriate to bark, even if one doesn't know what one is barking about.</p>
          <p>Stitch likes to sleep in the bathroom between the toilet and the shower.</p>
